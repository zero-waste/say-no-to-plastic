# Shops

## hiSbe Food CIC
So many loose products that you can only buy in hisBe.

## Infinity Foods (vegetarian)
Long-established vegetarian supermarket.

# Restaurants

## Silo
Zero-waste restaurant/cafe/coffee. Not vegetarian but increasingly
plant-focused. Notably their in-house composter (which actually lives in the
restaurant) has such an appetite that they also take in waste from the
surrounding businesses.

## Burger Brothers
Burger specialists and they use reassuringly biodegradable boxes.
