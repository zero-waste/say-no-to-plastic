All these recipes use a percentage of salt. If 1.6% salt is required, 1000g of veg would need 16g of salt. But you should always taste the raw mix anyway. 1.6% is the minimum I've gotten away with and experienced no spoiling. But this is in my climate (southern UK) and my house.

# Basic principles of fermented cabbage

There's plenty of shop-bought kimchi in Brighton but very few in eco-friendly
packaging. So why not make your own?

- 100% red cabbage (loose, Infinity Foods)
- 25% wild garlic (wild, The Downs)
- 1.6% salt
- 1% red chilli (loose, Taj)

Chop everything and mix in the salt. Crush with your hands to get the juices
flowing (if it's a particularly tough cabbage you might need to use a pestle).
Leave for ten minutes and repeat until there's a good amount of liquid in the
bottom of the bowl.

Pack into a glass jar leaving about 20% expansion space and close the lid.

Keep out of the sunlight, it should start to bubble by day two. Taste it after a
week. Is it delicious? If so, eat on homemade bread with aioli. 

The flavour profile evolves over the course of a few weeks. If you manage to not
eat it all you'll notice the taste drops off after a few weeks. If you really
like the taste on a certain day move it to the fridge to slow it down.

# Fermented salsa

- Two large tomatoes, coarsely chopped
- Half as much onion as toms, 5mm dice
- Two garlic cloves, finely chopped
- A few radishes, finely sliced
- One red chilli, finely sliced

The denser the vegetable the finer it needs cutting.

Put it all into a mixing bowl on a scale, add 1.6% of the weight of the veg in
salt. Mush it between your fingers until mixed and quite liquid. Add to a jar,
almost to the brim, pop the lid on and leave in a dark cupboard for up to a
week. You can put it in a fridge if you like but the acidity should stop
anything untoward occurring.

# Okraut

A experiment to see how okra behaves. The addition of okra makes it quite slippery! So possibly not for everybody. But
still.

# Beer and wine
[Bison Brewery](http://bisonbeer.co.uk/) sell large refillable bottles of
beer affectionately known as "growlers" from their shop on East Street. If
purchasing beer from a supermarket then don't choose those with six-pack rings.
Ten packs come in a cardboard box with no plastic. Or go to the pub. Or brew
your own!

# Bottle cleaning
Use an abrasive like old rice and a few drops of washing up liquid.
