# End of year review
Pledge to keep everything that is neither biodegradable nor recyclable in your
area or office. Below is my last nine month's worth. Obviously there's still
work to do but keeping everything is an excellent reminder.

Clockwise from top left:

- Tin foil from chocolate bars and breakfast roll
- Fruit trays
- Apple stickers
- Coffee lids
- Bike light/shirt packaging
- Vitamins and medicine In blister packs
- Assorted plastic bags (mostly fruit and bread)
- Foil wrappers from crisps, seeds and chocolate
