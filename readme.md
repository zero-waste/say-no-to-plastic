I've been thinking about this granola for a while and finally found some dried
fruit that doesn't come in a plastic bag. It's basically 300g of oats and then
60g of anything else you have to hand.
![](/assets/granola.jpg)

__From hiSbe Food CIC (loose):__

300g large oats

60g cacao nibs

60g dried goji berries

__From Waitrose:__

60g Silverspoon UK-grown caster sugar (paper bag)

__From Adam the apiarist - Surrey Honey (glass jar):__

60g Surrey honey

__From Taj (glass jar)__

60g Coconut oil

Combine everything bar the berries (lest they burn), spread on a tray and cook
at 200C for 8 minutes until brown (give it a stir around halfway through). I
tend to chuck the berries on top when it comes out of the oven.

Actually you can chuck just about anything in and 60g seems a good proportion. I
try not to make it too much about seeds but hemp and flax make an interesting
addition. And if you're feeling flush you can omit the sugar and double up on
the honey. I have tried olive oil when I've run out of coconut but it seems to
catch (burn) very easily. Keep an eye on it.

Once you're happy with it check your Twitter for a while whilst it cools and
transfer to an airtight container. This does keep it nice and crisp but we're
all busy people and it will keep quite happily for a week covered in the baking
tray.

Starting with 300g of oats makes one baking tray's worth. I tend to do two at
once, the lower one stays in for the first eight minutes, stir and then
I bring it to the top for a further four minutes.

Shop bought bread can really only come from a proper baker. In this case it's chewy white
from Real Pâtisserie. You can get Real Pâtisserie bread from Taj but it mostly comes in 
perforated plastic bags. At a push you could buy buns from Waitrose and put them in the
plain paper bags from the mushroom section rather than those with the plastic panel.

Apart from baguettes! You can also use the spare paper bags for other groceries rather
than the plastic ones.

I must confess I've only recently started visiting [hisBe](http://hisbe.co.uk/) regularly: when the zero-waste ideal really clicked in my brain. I tend to write articles about products but hisBe have so many things that only _they_ do that it makes more sense to list them on one page.

title: Plastic bags
layout: post

It goes without saying: no plastic bags. Ever! People argue that they reuse
them, but how many times must they be reused to justify the decades they will be
hanging around afterwards? Must they be handed down to their children to offset
the manufacturing cost and environmental impact? Even official bags-for-life are
unlikely to last for the duration of your lifetime as claimed. But a cotton bag
will at least have a chance of decomposition when it has reached the end of its
useful life.

The answer can only be to not use plastic bags at all. See [this
article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122238422541876879) in the Wall Street
Journal.

this mean they can't be recycled in store?"

We're fortunate enough to have a good supply in Brighton so it's difficult to
justify bottled water. But it is of course treated. If you're concerned about
chlorination for general consumption or home baking then it can be left to stand
or boiled.

Infinity Foods stock _Life_ refillable bottles if you'd rather have mineral
water: "which is sourced from springs on certified organic land in
Pembrokeshire."

__"We are evolved to eat meat"__ - It cannot be denied that we derive sustenance
by eating animals. But does that mean it's good for us? And the planet? We could
*exist* by eating a mono diet of puffins but would we be healthy? Equally we can
live perfectly happily on only plants.

__"Drinking cows' milk is unnatural"__ - We can only consume our own species?

__"I only eat animals that have been looked after"__ - But does it matter?
You're still slaughtering and eating them. Is this for your benefit or the animal?

__"I'm an animal lover [but I'm not a vegan]"__ - How can you love animals and
eat _any_ of them? You love consuming animals? You love _some_ animals and eat the
rest?

__"I eat cows but eating dogs is wrong"__ - What's acceptable to eat is, of
course, completely arbitrary and driven by culture and religion.

Is it size? I don't think so: cows are good (unless you're Hindu), horses bad.

Is it intelligence? No. Pigs are reportedly as intelligent as dogs.

Is it scarcity? Still no. Tigers bad, cod fine.

Is it cuteness? Absolutely not. We eat tonnes of lamb but foxes go untouched
bar the hunting.

__"I don't eat animals but dairy is OK"__ - Do animals naturally live in a state
of permanent pregnancy? If it were part of the natural cycle of the animal then
it could be argued that's OK. But is this true for dairy cows?

__"Animals are there for us to eat"__ - For survival, perhaps. But we grow
plants to mass produce animals. If they're ours to eat why stop at one level of
indirection? Why not fell forests to grow soy to raise cattle to rear crocodiles
and then eat the crocodiles? Perhaps soy-fed cow crocs are tastier than
grass-fed cattle?

Or we could just eat the soy and live perfectly healthy lives without killing
anything.

title: Which types of plastic can be recycled?
layout: post

From [Brighton and Hove recycling
FAQ](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-faqs)

## Bottle recycling in Brighton

Plastic bottles are the only plastics that Brighton & Hove and many other local
authorities currently recycle. Plastic bottles are mainly made from PET plastic
(soft drinks and water bottles) and HDPE (milk and detergent bottles). There are
already markets for plastic bottles as these can be recycled back into bottles
or even fleeces!

There are several reasons why other plastics are not currently being recycled.
These include:
- There are not well developed and secure markets for all plastics. This means
  we may not be able to sell them on.
- Even though some items such as food trays might be made from PET, they have
  different properties than the PET used to make bottles. This means we may not
  be able to process the material.
- Plastics are used to make food trays and there is a concern that residents
  might place trays out for recycling that still contain food. If too much
  recycling becomes contaminated, it cannot be processed.

## Lids

> Yes as the lids are made from different plastics so can contaminate the
> recycling. Please wash and squash your plastic bottles and put them in your
> recycling box without lids. 

And come contradictory advice from Twitter:

> BHCC_Cityclean (@RecyclingRefuse) Jan 7 2016, on communal recycling bins:
>  If you're removing plastic lids from glass bottles, just unscrew the top and
>  leave the ring attached to the bottle. You can cut them off if you really
>  want to remove them. Plastic bottles can have them left on. Ryan.

title: Kimchi / sauerkraut
layout: post

![](/assets/kimchi1.jpg)

There's plenty of shop-bought kimchi in Brighton but very few in eco-friendly
packaging. So why not make your own?

- 100% red cabbage (loose, Infinity Foods)
- 25% wild garlic (wild, The Downs)
- 1.6% [salt](/2016/08/20/salt.html)
- 1% red chilli (loose, Taj)

Chop everything and mix in the salt. Crush with your hands to get the juices
flowing (if it's a particularly tough cabbage you might need to use a pestle).
Leave for ten minutes and repeat until there's a good amount of liquid in the
bottom of the bowl.

Pack into a glass jar, leaving about 20% expansion space and close. This jar has
a nice silicone lid to let the gas out.

Keep out of the sunlight, it should start to bubble by day two. Taste it after a
week. Is it delicious? If so, eat on homemade bread with aioli. 

The flavour profile evolves over the course of a few weeks. If you manage to not
eat it all you'll notice the taste drops off after a few weeks. If you really
like the taste on a certain day move it to the fridge to slow it down.
