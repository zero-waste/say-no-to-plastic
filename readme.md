# End of year review
Pledge to keep everything that doesn't biodegrade nor is recyclable in your
area or office. This is my last nine month's worth.

Clockwise from top left:

- Tin foil from chocolate bars and breakfast roll
- Fruit trays
- Apple stickers
- Coffee lids
- Bike light/shirt packaging
- Vitamins and medicine In blister packs
- Assorted plastic bags (mostly fruit and bread)
- Foil wrappers from crisps, seeds and chocolate
