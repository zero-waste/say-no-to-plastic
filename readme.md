# End of year review of my work zero waste pot
Pledge to keep everything that doesn't biodegrade nor is recyclable in your
area or office. This is my last nine month's worth.

![](images/zero-waste-review-2016-1.jpg)

The jar emptied out, clockwised from top left:

- Tin foil from chocolate bars and breakfast roll
- Fruit trays
- Apple stickers
- Coffee lids
- Bike light/shirt packaging
- Vitamins and medicine In blister packs
- Assorted plastic bags (mostly fruit and bread)
- Foil wrappers from crisps, seeds and chocolate
- Most things I keep in a jar.

# Bike clips
Old school "trouser bands" rather then the cooler snappy things that are made
from bits of plastic and self-destruct after a couple of months.

# The only post on animal welfare and passive aggression (skip if not important to you)
__"We are evolved to eat meat"__ - It cannot be denied that we derive sustenance
by eating animals. But does that mean it's good for us? And the planet? We could
*exist* by eating a mono diet of puffins but would we be healthy? Equally we can
live perfectly happily on only plants.

__"Drinking cows' milk is unnatural"__ - We can only consume our own species?

__"I only eat animals that have been looked after"__ - But does it matter?
You're still slaughtering and eating them. Is this for your benefit or the animal?

__"I'm an animal lover [but I'm not a vegan]"__ - How can you love animals and
eat _any_ of them? You love consuming animals? You love _some_ animals and eat the
rest?

__"I eat cows but eating dogs is wrong"__ - What's acceptable to eat is, of
course, completely arbitrary and driven by culture and religion.

Is it size? I don't think so: cows are good (unless you're Hindu), horses bad.

Is it intelligence? No. Pigs are reportedly as intelligent as dogs.

Is it scarcity? Still no. Tigers bad, cod fine.

Is it cuteness? Absolutely not. We eat tonnes of lamb but foxes go untouched
bar the hunting.

__"I don't eat animals but dairy is OK"__ - Do animals naturally live in a state
of permanent pregnancy? If it were part of the natural cycle of the animal then
it could be argued that's OK. But is this true for dairy cows?

__"Animals are there for us to eat"__ - For survival, perhaps. But we grow
plants to mass produce animals. If they're ours to eat why stop at one level of
indirection? Why not fell forests to grow soy to raise cattle to rear crocodiles
and then eat the crocodiles? Perhaps soy-fed cow crocs are tastier than
grass-fed cattle?

Or we could just eat the soy and live perfectly healthy lives without killing
anything.

# Ready meals
The veggie ready meal section in Waitrose. Without exception each has a plastic tray or panel.

![](images/readymeal_waitrose.jpg)

Interestingly the frozen section has plenty of choice in simply packaged
products.

# Low-impact granola
I've been thinking about this granola for a while and finally found some dried
fruit that doesn't come in a plastic bag. It's basically 300g of oats and then
60g of anything else you have to hand.

![](images/granola.jpg)

__From hiSbe Food CIC (loose):__

- 300g large oats
- 60g cacao nibs
- 60g dried goji berries

__From Waitrose:__

- 60g Silverspoon UK-grown caster sugar (paper bag)

__From Adam the apiarist - Surrey Honey (glass jar):__

- 60g Surrey honey

__From Taj (glass jar)__

- 60g Coconut oil

Combine everything bar the berries (lest they burn), spread on a tray and cook
at 200C for 8 minutes until brown (give it a stir around halfway through). I
tend to chuck the berries on top when it comes out of the oven.

Actually you can chuck just about anything in and 60g seems a good proportion. I
try not to make it too much about seeds but hemp and flax make an interesting
addition. And if you're feeling flush you can omit the sugar and double up on
the honey. I have tried olive oil when I've run out of coconut but it seems to
catch (burn) very easily. Keep an eye on it.

Once you're happy with it check your Twitter for a while whilst it cools and
transfer to an airtight container. This does keep it nice and crisp but we're
all busy people and it will keep quite happily for a week covered with another
baking tray.

Starting with 300g of oats makes one baking tray's worth. I tend to do two at
once, the lower one stays in for the first eight minutes, stir and then I bring
it to the top for a further four minutes.

# Bread
Shop bought bread can really only come from a proper baker. In this case it's
chewy white from Real Pâtisserie. You can get Real Pâtisserie bread from Taj but
it mostly comes in perforated plastic bags. At a push you could buy buns from
Waitrose and put them in the plain paper bags from the mushroom section rather
than those with the plastic panel.

![](images/bread_real_patisserie.jpg)

Apart from baguettes! You can also use the spare paper bags for other groceries rather
than the plastic ones.

![](images/baguettes.jpg)

Cracking sea salt and rosemary sourdough from hisBe. Wow! 

![](images/bread_hisbe.jpg)

Deft lame work from Silo.

![](images/bread_silo.jpg)

# Fruit

Why would you buy a net of tiny lemons from a supermarket when you could have
these beauties?

![](images/lemon_taj.jpg)

And finally some loose British apples from Taj!

![](images/british_apples.jpg)

Loose apples from Waitrose.

![](images/apples_waitrose.jpg)

And loose French Pink Ladies from Sainsbury's Local. Expensive at £4+ per
kilo but still.

![](images/apple_sainsburys.jpg)

By contrast, organic apples from Waitrose. Each sealed in plastic and with a
choice of carbon footprint: Argentina, Chile or New Zealand.

![](images/apples2_waitrose.jpg)

# Oats
The first oats I found that didn't come in a plastic bag or a box with a plastic
panel. They even suggest you compost the packet. Love Pimhill Farm!

![](images/oats_pimhill.jpg)

Loose oats from hisBe are very reasonably priced and you can take your own
vessel.

![](images/oats_hisbe.jpg)

I'm very fond of Wessex Mill's bread flour and just spotted their oats in Taj.

![](images/oats_wessexmill.jpg)

And a couple from Waitrose in paper packaging. However, if we're going to be
fussy&mdash;and we shall&mdash;they both feature an unnecessary plastic tab on the top.

![](images/oats_flahavans.jpg)
![](images/oats_mornflake.jpg)

# Toilet roll
Paper from FSC approved sources, plastic in the Waitrose carrier bag recycling.

![](images/toiletroll_waitrose1.jpg)

And more recently, toilet roll made from recycled paper.

![](images/toiletroll_waitrose2.jpg)

# Cheese
Where can you buy cheese without any packaging? Tricky. La Cave à Fromage in
Hove is the answer. They're very accommodating and let me use my own box: zero
packaging with my delicious [Mayfield
Swiss](https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/recipes_wiki/Mayfield_Swiss_cheese), a
vegetarian mountain cheese made in Sussex. 

![](images/cheese_lacave.jpg)

And here's some Labneh (yoghurt) in a jar from Taj. It pretty much tastes like
the beautiful goat cheese figuettes but at a fraction of the price. 

![](images/labneh_taj.jpg)

# Sandwich greens
All major supermarkets pack their greens in plastic so they're out. However, Taj
do bundles of spinach with no packaging; we just need to juice the stems, compost the
roots and put the rubber bands to good use.

![](images/spinach_taj.jpg)
![](images/spinach_taj2.jpg)

Proper spring onions from Taj!

![](images/spring_onions.jpg)

# hiSbe Food CIC
I must confess I've only recently started visiting [hisBe](http://hisbe.co.uk/)
regularly: when the zero-waste ideal really clicked in my brain. I tend to write
articles about products but hisBe have so many things that only _they_ do that
it makes more sense to list them on one page.

__Deydrated coconut__

![](images/coconut_hisbe.jpg)

__Cacao nibs__

![](images/nibs_hisbe.jpg)

__Chocolate__

Loose plain, milk and white chocolate buttons. They're only £10/Kg too, whereas
Waitrose is at £15-20/Kg for a 100g bar of Green and Blacks. And you have to do
something with the packaging.

![](images/chocolate_hisbe.jpg)

# Newspapers
In the week newspapers are generally OK but at the weekend the food/environment pullouts must come in a plastic bag for convenience.

# Plastic bags

It goes without saying: no plastic bags. Ever! People argue that they reuse
them, but how many times must they be reused to justify the decades they will be
hanging around afterwards? Must they be handed down to their children to offset
the manufacturing cost and environmental impact? Even official bags-for-life are
unlikely to last for the duration of your lifetime as claimed. But a cotton bag
will at least have a chance of decomposition when it has reached the end of its
useful life.

The answer can only be to not use plastic bags at all. See [this
article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122238422541876879) in the Wall Street
Journal.

Various Twitter chat about plastic bags:

__Waitrose__

Dean Turbo @deanturbo  Jan 3 2016:

"@waitrose hi! Can beercan plastic rings go in with the plastic bag recycling?
And are they sorted manually when they leave the store?"

Waitrose @waitrose  Jan 3 2016:

"@deanturbo I'm afraid not - only plastic bags and film displaying the OPRL logo
can be recycled"

On-Pack Recycling Label: http://www.oprl.org.uk/

__Sainsbury's__

Dean Turbo @deanturbo  Jan 12 2016:

"@sainsburys Hi! Just noticed the 5p bags don't have the OPRL logo on them. Does
this mean they can't be recycled in store?"

Sainsbury's @sainsburys  Jan 12 2016:

"@deanturbo Hi Dean, they're made of recycled material and are recyclable, we'll
replace them free of charge if they become damaged." 

And here are some biodegradable bin bags from Infinity Foods. See
[d2w](http://d2w.net).

# Tea, please...
A goodly selection of loose tea and tea-supping accoutrements from Bluebird Tea Co. and 10% discount for bringing your own pot.

![](images/tea_bluebird.jpg)
![](images/tea_bluebird2.jpg)

Heath and Heather offer tea without the unnecessary paper pouches.

![](images/tea_heathandheather.jpg)

Failing that, Pukka do tea in wholly recyclable paper packaging.

![](images/tea_pukka.jpg)

As do Yogi. But be careful as I have seen some in plastic wrap!

![](images/tea_yogi.jpg)

As an aside: all three look like they're tied shut. But the Heath and Heather
also appear to be thermally sealed suggesting a small quantity of plastic in the
paper mix.

# Beer and wine
[Bison Brewery](http://bisonbeer.co.uk/) sell large refillable bottles of
beer--affectionately known as "growlers"--from their shop on East Street. If
purchasing beer from a supermarket then don't choose those with six-pack rings.
Ten packs come in a cardboard box with no plastic. Or go to the pub. Or brew
your own!

# Precious Plastic
Small scale plastic processing kits. The future!

http://preciousplastic.com/

# Cleaning products
Lots of options for buying soap without packaging but this is by Faith In
Nature and smells of rosemary. Bought from hisBe.

![](images/soap_faith.jpg)

And a Vatika bar from Taj wrapped only in cardboard.

![](images/soap_vatika.jpg)

Loose fabric conditioner from hisBe:

![](images/fabric_conditioner.jpg)

# Refuse collection
It's easy to forget how convenient it is for somebody else to sort your rubbish
out for you. Brighton during the bin strike, June 2013. 

![](images/bin_strike.jpg)

# Honey
![](images/honey_brighton.jpg)

Spoilt for choice with honey. This was excellent from Surrey. So good I ate it
before I managed to take a photo.

![](images/honey_surrey.jpg)

A great selection of Payne's honey from Taj.

![](images/honey_paynes.jpg)

# Water
We're fortunate enough to have a good supply in Brighton so it's difficult to
justify bottled water. But it is of course treated. If you're concerned about
chlorination for general consumption or home baking then it can be left to stand
or boiled.

Infinity Foods stock _Life_ refillable bottles if you'd rather have mineral
water: "which is sourced from springs on certified organic land in
Pembrokeshire."

For some bottle facts see [Ban the
Bottle](https://www.banthebottle.net/bottled-water-facts/). And see how
[Southern Water](https://www.southernwater.co.uk/water-treatment) treat what
comes out of our taps.

# Spectacular low-impact cheese sandwich

- Bread, Silo
- Smoked cheddar, La Cave à Fromage
- Spinach, Taj
- Tomatoes, The Open Market
- Harissa and mayonnaise in glass jars (no plastic seal), Waitrose

## Waste
- Two paper bags to recycle/reuse 
- Two rubber bands to repurpose

# Glass jars
layout: post

Love a nice glass jar. And if you end up with too many somewhere like
[Silo](http://www.silobrighton.com) or [Flank](http://www.flankbrighton.com/)
will probably take them off your hands. Make sure to avoid those with plastic
seals. 

![](images/glass_jars.jpg)

# I remember when everything around here was sealed in small claustrophobic boxes
Before long all you see is plastic. Equal-portioned high-carbon footprint
produce condemned to a petrochemical tomb. As nature intended.

![](images/plastic_waitrose.jpg)

# Dried fruit
Dried goji berries from hisBe.

# Which types of plastic can be recycled?
From [Brighton and Hove recycling
FAQ](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-faqs)

## Bottle recycling in Brighton

Plastic bottles are the only plastics that Brighton & Hove and many other local
authorities currently recycle. Plastic bottles are mainly made from PET plastic
(soft drinks and water bottles) and HDPE (milk and detergent bottles). There are
already markets for plastic bottles as these can be recycled back into bottles
or even fleeces!

There are several reasons why other plastics are not currently being recycled.
These include:
- There are not well developed and secure markets for all plastics. This means
  we may not be able to sell them on.
- Even though some items such as food trays might be made from PET, they have
  different properties than the PET used to make bottles. This means we may not
  be able to process the material.
- Plastics are used to make food trays and there is a concern that residents
  might place trays out for recycling that still contain food. If too much
  recycling becomes contaminated, it cannot be processed.

## Lids

> Yes as the lids are made from different plastics so can contaminate the
> recycling. Please wash and squash your plastic bottles and put them in your
> recycling box without lids. 

And come contradictory advice from Twitter:

> BHCC_Cityclean (@RecyclingRefuse) Jan 7 2016, on communal recycling bins:
>  If you're removing plastic lids from glass bottles, just unscrew the top and
>  leave the ring attached to the bottle. You can cut them off if you really
>  want to remove them. Plastic bottles can have them left on. Ryan.

# Soya milk and Tetra Pack recycling
Couldn't find the Tetra Pack recycling point on the [council website](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/recycling-bins-map) but it's [here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@50.8285584,-0.1377455,3a,15y,296.01h,78.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swEfHWdBDEH__9ClosMu0Vg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en). Magpie might collect them too.

![](images/tetrapacks.jpg)

Alpro and granaVita have slightly fewer components: some of them have an extra plastic bung. 

![](images/soya_milk.jpg)

And Bonsoy has no plastic bits... yey! (But it is twice the price.)

![](images/bonsoy.jpg)

# Loose peppers
In Waitrose you can buy two loose peppers. Or two peppers in a plastic bag. 

![](images/peppers_waitrose.jpg)

# Bike snacks
Pop some of these in your jersey. Loose apricots from Taj.

![](images/apricots_taj.jpg)

Note: paper bag is from hisBe, they only have plastic bags in Taj.

# Lemongrass
Nice bit of lemongrass from Taj.
![](images/lemongrass_taj.jpg)

You can repurpose the bands or make an awesome rubber band ball!

![](images/rubberband_ball.jpg)

# Kimchi / sauerkraut

![](images/kimchi1.jpg)

There's plenty of shop-bought kimchi in Brighton but very few in eco-friendly
packaging. So why not make your own?

- 100% red cabbage (loose, Infinity Foods)
- 25% wild garlic (wild, The Downs)
- 1.6% salt
- 1% red chilli (loose, Taj)

Chop everything and mix in the salt. Crush with your hands to get the juices
flowing (if it's a particularly tough cabbage you might need to use a pestle).
Leave for ten minutes and repeat until there's a good amount of liquid in the
bottom of the bowl.

Pack into a glass jar, leaving about 20% expansion space and close. This jar has
a nice silicone lid to let the gas out.

Keep out of the sunlight, it should start to bubble by day two. Taste it after a
week. Is it delicious? If so, eat on homemade bread with aioli. 

The flavour profile evolves over the course of a few weeks. If you manage to not
eat it all you'll notice the taste drops off after a few weeks. If you really
like the taste on a certain day move it to the fridge to slow it down.

![](images/kimchi2.jpg)
![](images/kimchi4.jpg)

# ASUS laptop
New laptop. That's _so_ close to using only recyclable packaging. Come on, guys!

![](images/asus_laptop.jpg)

# Salt
hisBe have pulled out the stops and are now enabling us to buy salt without also buying bits of plastic to pour it with.

![](images/salt_hisbe.jpg)

Alternatively, Tidman's might just save the day.

http://www.maldonsalt.co.uk/Products-Tidmans-Salt.html

# Vegetable bouillon
Not something I'd even considered buying loose. hisBe are great.

![](images/bouillon.jpg)

# Socks
I didn't think I would be posting about socks when I started this but hey!
Interesting material and minimal packaged. In fact the only thing that wasn't
recyclable was the security tag on the back.

![](images/socks.jpg)

# Mye Mye
New pan-Asian restaurant Mye Mye. If you pick carefully you can walk out with
all biodegradable packaging. And it's tasty!

![](images/myemye.jpg)

# Sugar
I used to use Billington's for bread making but why does it only come
wrapped in plastic? Old school Tate and Lyle it is. 

![](images/sugar_tate.jpg)

Paper packaging, made in Britain: cannot argue with that.

![](images/sugar_silverspoon.jpg)

Or just for kicks why not try coconut sugar?

![](images/coconut_sugar.jpg)

# Okrakraut
- 2 large tomatoes
- 1 long shallot
- 1/2 red chilli
- 2% salt (by weight)

Chop the tomatoes coarsely, everything else fine. Add the salt and crush the
mixture with your hands. Add to a jar making sure everything is submerged. Leave
for five days or so until it is zingy.

![](images/fermented_salsa1.jpg)
![](images/fermented_salsa2.jpg)

The addition of okra makes it quite slippery! So possibly not for everybody. But
still.
