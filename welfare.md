# Animal welfare and passive aggression (skip if not important to you)
__"We are evolved to eat meat"__ - It cannot be denied that we derive sustenance
by eating animals. But does that mean it's good for us? And the planet? We could
*exist* by eating a mono diet of puffins but would we be healthy? Equally we can
live perfectly happily on only plants.

__"Drinking cows' milk is unnatural"__ - We can only consume our own species?

__"I only eat animals that have been looked after"__ - But does it matter?
You're still slaughtering and eating them. Is this for your benefit or the animal?

__"I'm an animal lover [but I'm not a vegan]"__ - How can you love animals and
eat _any_ of them? You love consuming animals? You love _some_ animals and eat the
rest?

__"I eat cows but eating dogs is wrong"__ - What's acceptable to eat is, of
course, completely arbitrary and driven by culture and religion.

Is it size? I don't think so: cows are good (unless you're Hindu), horses bad.

Is it intelligence? No. Pigs are reportedly as intelligent as dogs.

Is it scarcity? Still no. Tigers bad, cod fine.

Is it cuteness? Absolutely not. We eat tonnes of lamb but foxes go untouched
bar the hunting.

__"I don't eat animals but dairy is OK"__ - Do animals naturally live in a state
of permanent pregnancy? If it were part of the natural cycle of the animal then
it could be argued that's OK. But is this true for dairy cows?

__"Animals are there for us to eat"__ - For survival, perhaps. But we grow
plants to mass produce animals. If they're ours to eat why stop at one level of
indirection? Why not fell forests to grow soy to raise cattle to rear crocodiles
and then eat the crocodiles? Perhaps soy-fed cow crocs are tastier than
grass-fed cattle?

Or we could just eat the soy and live perfectly healthy lives without killing
anything.
