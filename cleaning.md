# Cleaning products
Lots of options for buying soap without packaging but this is by Faith In
Nature and smells of rosemary. Bought from hisBe.

And a Vatika bar from Taj wrapped only in cardboard.

# Toilet roll
Paper from FSC approved sources, plastic in the Waitrose carrier bag recycling.

And more recently, toilet roll made from recycled paper.

# Socks
I didn't think I would be posting about socks when I started this but hey!
Interesting material and minimal packaged. In fact the only thing that wasn't
recyclable was the security tag on the back.
