# Mid-year review

What's the best way to assess your plastic usage? Keep all of it.

Pledge to keep everything that is neither biodegradable nor recyclable in your
area or office. A nice idea is to fill a jar and see how long it takes to fill
it. It makes it all the more horrifying when you have to thrown it away in bulk,
knowing that it's destined for the landfill.
