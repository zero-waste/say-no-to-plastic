Heath and Heather offer tea without the unnecessary paper pouches.

Failing that, Pukka do tea in wholly recyclable paper packaging.

As an aside: all three look like they're tied shut. But the Heath and Heather
also appear to be thermally sealed suggesting a small quantity of plastic in the
paper mix.
